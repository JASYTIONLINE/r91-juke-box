# This Is Your Song — Project 03 Proposal

This site is a working proof of concept for a custom songwriting service called 
**This Is Your Song**. The goal is to show how a simple, functional, and engaging 
front-end could support a unique service idea using nothing but HTML and CSS.

## What This Site Demonstrates

- **Homepage introduction with embedded audio**  
  The jingle is short and attention-grabbing — designed to catch the user's interest 
  without demanding too much time. It serves as a hook to drive curiosity and 
  increase click-through to the catalog page.

- **Music catalog with genre previews**  
  Features four interpretations of the same lyrics, each arranged in a different style. 
  This showcases the flexibility of the service to tailor a song’s mood, tone, and 
  delivery for different occasions and audiences.

- **Navigation between pages**  
  Simple, obvious navigation helps users move between homepage and catalog with one 
  click. The design avoids clutter or complexity, making it easier to stay focused.

- **High-contrast, eye-catching buttons**  
  Buttons are intentionally large and bold for visual clarity, accessibility, and to 
  drive clicks. Important actions are made obvious and easy to find, even for users 
  with limited vision or attention.

- **Anchor-triggered inline PDF preview**  
  A hidden sample order form opens within the page when triggered — no popups or 
  modals required. This keeps the interface clean while still delivering functionality. 
  Once opened, users can easily continue navigating the page without needing to close 
  or back out.

- **Email-based ordering with structured prompts**  
  The catalog page includes a mailto link that pre-fills a structured template. This 
  allows the user to start their order with minimal effort and helps ensure complete, 
  usable information.

- **Responsive layout and design**  
  Layout adjusts fluidly for mobile screens. Buttons stack, audio players stay visible, 
  and all interactive content remains accessible regardless of screen size.

- **Separation of content and styling**  
  The entire site is styled using a single external CSS file. HTML structure and visual 
  presentation are separated to demonstrate clean, maintainable development practice.
